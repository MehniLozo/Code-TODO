# A simple Code-TODO 
SO whatchu gonna do in your coding phase , which feature should be implemented first.
This little CLI-Tool gonna scrape your most-wanted several repos and add the TODO's requirements onto its database
Therefore,you decide whether you want to create an issue from that TODO or even another branch in a certain repo via the CLI-TOOL

## How it works


## TODO
- Engine for the listing
- MVC Architecture for CLI communication
- Application Dockertization
